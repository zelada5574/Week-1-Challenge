# What was done with this challenge

We were given two files of html and css that had "wet" or repetitive code that needed to be refactored in order to create accessible files for any future users who review the code. We also needed to maintain the same page that was given to us as a sample to be kept. I couldn't adjust the page in anyway.

## Accessability and what to expect

In order to make the html files more accessible, I replaced the various div elements with other semantic html elements to add more description and help any future readers understand what that section does. For example, the aside element was used to describe the side bar on the webpage rather than just a div.

In addition to replacing various html elements, I shortened the css file where code was written repetitivly for similar class, elements, or ids. I would delete extra lines and merge class, elements, or ids where applicable.
